# What?
Just an implementation of [exponential search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_search)
via C++'s template meta-programming along with a [demo use case](./demo.cpp)
for optimizing storage given a constraint.

Nothing complicated (the algorithm is super straightforward, 
see [Python version](./exp_search.py), I just thought it's cool).

The implementation can be found in [`ExponentialSearch.h`](./ExponentialSearch.h).



# Why?
I took a class about generic software engineering, where I learned
template meta-programming in C++. Had another class where we had
to optimize storage, so I thought why not apply this?

There probably better ways of doing this and it's not like it's
some complicated problem either. So this is just something I
did for fun because template meta-programming is actually
quite cool I think, haha.
